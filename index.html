          <h2>Web Developer + Health Coach</h2>
          <p>I am an organizer, a researcher, a manager and a advocate for animal rights.</p>

          <p>I have an inquisitive mind, a drive to research the truth and a great passion for leading and organizing others in ways that plant the seeds of change. I have focused my efforts into opening eyes to understand how to optimize lives through whole food plant based nutrition. Thus breaking the dependence on animals. Ultimately to win hearts and minds for the suffering of the innocent. I currently serve on the board of the Animal Protection & Rescue League of Orange County as the Director of Campaigns and Outreach. </p>

          <!-- <p>I have a unique combination of skills for approaching this mission in a variety of venues and shifting fields. I have experience and proficiency in outreach to diverse groups of people using event planning and social media marketing strategies, in team building using compassionate management and mentoring, in software and web engineering using agile methodologies, and in research and evaluation of data and complex systems. I am a compassionate people-oriented manager, forming strong teams through thoughtful and caring interaction, mentoring, and practical schedules. I enjoy leading teams that blend software with real world elements that improve the world. My approach to nutritional research is aided by my strong theoretical and analytical backgrounds.</p> -->
